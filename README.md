**About**

I am currently on an apprenticeship with Imagin3d, training with CodeNation. My first draw to software was how it could help organize and visualize complex environmental data. Working through the CodeNation course, I have solidified my love of the visual side of tech. I look forward to developing as a UX/UI professional and achieving a deeper understanding of forward-thinking accessible and attractive design.
